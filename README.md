# Data Science Practice

This repository was created solely for the sake of learning and reference for topics in data science. It contains:

##  Dataquest Guided Projects

This repository is a collection of my implementations of the guided projects from Dataquest.io.

## Kaggle SQL Practice

I participated in Kaggle's "SQL Summer Camp" and the corresponding exercises are included here.

## HackerRank SQL Practice

To further improve my experience with SQL, I have been completing HackerRank SQL challenges. This is organized into folders depending on category (ex: "Basic Select") with the exercises included in the corresponding folder. All implementations are in MySQL.
